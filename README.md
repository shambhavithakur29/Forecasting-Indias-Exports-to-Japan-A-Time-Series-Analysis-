# Forecasting India's Exports to Japan: A Time Series Analysis
This project analyses the impact of macroeconomic factors/shocks on India's exports to Japan.

## Data and the model
The data spans over 2000-2024. The linear regression model has India'a exports to Japan (USD)as the dependent variable and Japan's GDP (USD), Exchange rate (INR/Yen) and Oil prices (USD/Barrel) as the independent variables. 
The linear equation is as such: <br>
India's Exports to Japan = Japan's GDP + Exchnage rate (INR/Yen) + Oil price <br>

The analysis is performed on Python (Jupyter Notebook), using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SkLearn. The steps involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, regression analysis and forecasting exports. 

## Results and Observations
The variable, "Oil Price" is seen as crucial determinant of changes in Exports from India to Japan and a 19.5% export growth from India to Japan is forecasted for 2026.
